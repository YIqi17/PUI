                  <p class ="bodytext">In this piece, I collected 100 pieces of Chinese types of the last century (1900-1999). I want to show how Chinese typography had transformed during the one hundred years and use it to mirror the shifts and historical upheavals that happened in China. People often forget that typography is also part of history. It loyally records every second of history. This website attempts to record the transformations of Chinese fonts in the past 100 years, anticipating the audience will then be able to understand the history behind these texts and how historical upheavals influenced Chinese type’s formation.

                     Once the mouse lands on the first word, the lifeless webpage suddenly gains color and excitement. If one moves the mouse downward, he or she will see the Chinese type appear next to the English word one by one. The alluring Chinese calligraphies are glowing like neon lights, illuminating the pitch dark background. A piece of melodious old-fashioned jazz music broke the quietness, adding another dimension. The duet of saxophone and piano plays the rhythm of the ninety century. A sweet female voice chants gently in Chinese, a language that is unfamiliar to the western world. The music reminds me of old shanghai,
                     where gorgeous fashionable ladies would sing this melody in the dance halls. At this time, the website takes us back to the era of the Republic of China. It’s a good time when rich people had the luxury to enjoy life and novel things Westernization had brought to them. It is a time period when the Chinese people are embracing the “Modern” western culture. At that time, the schools taught English, French, and theology, which are taught by foreign priests who came to preach. But it is undeniable that when the rich enjoyed life, most Chinese people were still suffering. While the rich were eating bread brought 
                     by the foreign cultures and learning novel foreign literature, the poor were still starving to death due to famine. Words appeared in this section: “freedom, spring & summer, sugar, and the nightingale” are so innocent just like China at that time: a pure untouched land. It is the time when poetry, music, and dream flourished.</p>
